🛡️ TrustShield Pro: Automated Security Audit System
Anuj Sharma Security Labs presents an enterprise-grade security monitoring tool designed to bridge the gap between complex technical vulnerabilities and actionable client insights.


🚀 The Challenge (Problem)
Security data is often buried in deep technical logs or scattered JSON files. For stakeholders and clients, understanding the real-time risk posture of a repository can be overwhelming and confusing.


✨ The Solution
TrustShield Pro automates the entire security auditing process. It fetches live data from the GitHub Advisory Database, assesses risks, and presents them through a high-end, branded dashboard.


💎 Key Features (The Wow Factor)
Fully Autonomous Scanning: Powered by GitHub Actions, the system performs a deep security audit every 24 hours with zero manual effort.
Professional Audit Reports: Users can download a timestamped, official security report (.txt) directly from the portal.
Real-Time Threat Detection: Dynamically tracks and displays the number of known vulnerabilities and branch protection status.

Enterprise UI: A responsive, professional dashboard built with Tailwind CSS for a premium client experience.
